# Week 2: Curves & Basic Interaction

## Overview
This week, I planned a review on how curves work in Processing. This includes a focus on control points,
a somewhat foggy topic I clarified using two demos, `ControlPointIllustration1` and `ControlPointIllustration2`.
Additionally, I included a very high overview of adding interation to Processing programs using `void setup()` and `void draw()`.

## Files
- `plan.tex` and `plan.pdf` — The notes I used while reviewing the content with students
- `ControlPointIllustration1` — A static demo that shows two curves with opposite control points and their effects
- `ControlPointIllustration2` — An interactive demo that shows how control points work by using the mouse to define one. I also suggest modifying the code to make
one control point static and the other defined by `mouseX` and `mouseY` to help students gain more intuition as to how these work.
- `Paint` — To motivate interaction, I demonstrated this simple paint program that lets the user draw a picture and erase the screen. Students were not familiar with all of the
structures used here, but I think it served as a great motivating example.
