# CS 105 (Digital Media Computing) Materials

## Introduction
Each semester that I TA (this is my fourth now!), I produce materials that I use during my mentored study group (MSG) sessions, which are held twice a week for two hours each. When I find that the materials might be useful to others or when there's enough of them, I release them for others to use. This repository holds the materials I used during my sessions during the spring semester of 2026.

## License
Please feel free to use these materials, adapt them, or change them, but please also attribute me if you do. Thank you!
